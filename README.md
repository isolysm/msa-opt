As Minecraft has gone on, Microsoft have been adding features to spite the community, and it is becoming very apparent.

This mod is only made to support 1.19 and above (including 1.19.84). 1.19 contains two issues relating to Microsoft's invasive tactics, and because of that,
we need to make sure this is turned off as fast as possible. 

## Why?
Well three main reasons. 

* **Minecraft Servers are privately owned.** Microsoft doesn't need to step in and waste resources on a problem that isn't even theirs. By doing this, they're indirectly wasting money, and it questions Microsoft's role in this entire thing.

* **You can get banned for the stupidest things ever.** I can get banned for profanity? Like what? I get that kids like to play this game and whatnot, but this is indirectly killing one of the pillars that make your game stand. If I talk about how alcohol is bad, am I going to be banned from multiplayer as a whole? A lot of questions are out here, and none of them will be answered.

* **It's Microsoft.** Yeah, no more I have to say.

To put it simply, **Microsoft won't back down from trying to add these features, which is really sad considering they're indirectly killing the game by 
suppressing their player's thoughts and expressions.**
